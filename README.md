## Introduction

This is a final project that applies linear regression to assess the relationship between the **human population** (in billions of people) and the **CO2 emission** (in billions of kilograms). We will seek answers through data analysis and look at several factors that could have led to global warming. Then, by drawing residual graphs and doing hypothesis testing to see which one of them has the largest impact on global warming.

## Research Question

1. What is the correlation between CO2 emissions and population growth in the United States? 
  
2. Between population growth and carbon dioxide emission, or both, what is/are the leading factor(s) of global warming?

## Hypothesis

1. the relationship between human population and carbon dioxide is non-linear.

2. increase in human population contributed more to the increase in global temperature than carbon dioxide emission.
